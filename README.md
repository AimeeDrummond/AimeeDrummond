### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I do apologize if my formating isn't the greatest. I am fairly new to navigating Github so for now my Knowledge is limited.
I am currently interested in learning about things such as database development and Web Development. But any knowledge I can get my hands on I won't say no to!
At the time of writing, I am currently working on a small side project in creating a discord bot! I'd like to use it for my own personal use in terms of quality of life improvements.
If I had to choose a favorite hobby, I must admit I am a bit of a VR enthusiast. Anything and everything virtual reality is right up my alley!
